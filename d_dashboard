Dynamic form-based dashboards in Splunk enable users to update and interact with dashboard data in real-time without leaving the page. This functionality is achieved by incorporating various input fields—such as time pickers, radio buttons, textboxes, checkboxes, and dropdowns—into the dashboard. These inputs allow users to refine and change the displayed data instantly based on their selections.
